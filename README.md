# DRIPPS
## Interface Browser to Study and Explore Discourse Relations

A new language resource, DRIPPS, an annotated corpus of discourse relations in sentences with perfect participial clauses in some varieties of Portuguese (European (EP), Brazilian (BP), Angolan (AP) and Mozambican (MP)) and British English (BE). The application allows one to load corpora, Portuguese varieties, and British English, in our case, and apply a set of selection constraints to obtain different views and statistics of the data, enabling a whole range of specific corpora analyses and studies.

[Figure 1](#figure-mainview) presents the application's main view, where the dataset of annotated sentences from different varieties/languages might be loaded into the main table, the main component of this view. The table presents one sentence per line with its corresponding annotations: Discourse Relation (DR), Semantic Role (SR), etc. The last column contains the sentences, which are not entirely visible. However, each table's selected sentence is totally visible below in a specific box for that purpose (light yellow colour). The set of buttons above the table, on the right-hand side, allows one to select the varieties/languagesâ€™ examples to be shown. Each one of these buttons can be independently activated and deactivated, meaning that different sets of varieties/languages can be combined and loaded into the table. In the screenshot we can see that only the European (EP) and Brazilian Portuguese (BP) varieties are selected.
